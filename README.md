## Problem Statement
Human bidders on the site are getting increasingly dissatisfied with their inability to win bids when compared to their software-controlled competitors. As a result, the usage among the site's core customers is declining.

Automated robots generate much of the bidding activity on electronic bidding markets and online auction platforms. As a result, human bidders on the site are getting increasingly dissatisfied with their inability to win bids when compared to their software-controlled competitors. This has led to a decline in usage among the site's core customers. Bidding robots such as “BidRobot” are pieces of software that are configured by the user to follow any number of auctions on different auction sites simultaneously, bidding in place of the user according to predefined settings and preferences. 
Humans are not capable of attending to and monitoring auctions with the same capacity as a computer, which can make complex bidding decisions in split-second time and can follow an auction with nonstop, undivided attention.

## How Does Bidding work?
There are the  steps involved in the bidding process:
- Communication with the seller during the auction
- Duration of the auction
- Dynamic Pricing
- Product Quality
- Distribution Network


Here are some factors that affect the business 

- **Communication with the seller during the auction**

  Communicating the qualities of the product being sold is another important factor
- **Duration of the auction**

  Sometimes the product in which the customer is interested is placed in the later phase of bidding, thus the “bid sniping” strategy should be used.
- **Dynamic Pricing**

  Setting up flexible prices for customers, depending upon their willingness to pay. Buyers require different levels of discount according to the item condition
